# My Portfolio 
(```my-portfolio``` - Module 2 Challenge)

## Description

- The goal of this project was to create a first version of my portfolio to introduce myself and to showcase a growing collection of my work, with links that take you to that work.
- This was achieved by building a basic webpage from scracth  using HTML and CSS.
- Code was written semantically where possible, and the styling was designed mobile-first and to be responsive (with a breakpoint for larger screens) in order to facilitate accessibility and usability.
- A Contact me section was included, with a form and links to my socials, so that people can get in touch with me.
- This is just the first version of the portfolio and the styling, interactivity and funcionality will develop over time.
